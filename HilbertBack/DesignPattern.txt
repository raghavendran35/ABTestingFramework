invariants: 
when performing any READ operations, validate the user (if they are not part of the organization)
when performing any DELETE operations, validate the user (as part of org) and admin level if it is deleteAll
when performing any CREATE operations, validate the user (as part of org)
when performing any Update operations, validate the user (as part of org)

GOING TO ASSUME THAT A CHANGE TO END DATE OF A BUCKET WILL NOT IMPACT EXPERIMENT AND VICE VERSA--
until needed----ASK MOHAN!!!!!



TODO:
-make sure that experimentController, userController, bucketController do not handle REST calls
-the business logic stuff must handle the calls, the experimentController, etc must have typical mapping methods
when

BizLogic Class
	-every call should run through this

	Experiments
	-during experiment creation, need to establish that start and end dates are valid
	-when assigning experiment to a user, check if user is part of organization and experiment is valid
	-is the selection routine valid?
	-in deleteAll, does person who is deleting have correct rights





	Buckets
	-during bucket creation, need to establish start and end dates are valid
	-status of the buckets for an experiment is "invalid" or "notStarted" unless total bucket allocation is 1.0
	-is the model attached to this valid?
	-is the experiment that a bucket is assigned to valid?
	-in deleteAll, does person who is deleting have correct rights





	Users
	-when creating user, is the org valid?
	-when reading all users, is the person who is viewing actually a part of the organization?
	-when performing deleteAll, does the person who is deleting have correct rights?
	-when changing the password, is the lastPasswordChange recent-within 12 hours (then some 2-step verification)-and is it actually the user themselves?
